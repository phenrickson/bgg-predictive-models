# tasks

- I want to add a series of new interactives feature related to unsupervised learning using a Streamlit app.
- I have started developing this in @/src/scripts/unsupervised_analysis.py but have not finished. The load_data() function in that dataset is going to be what I want to use as my starting point for the dataset to analyze.
 
 - I want to create a process that enables me to update and run the preprocessor used in generating features prior to fitting a dimension reduction method such as PCA. 
 - For instance, I want to be able to turn designer features off or on in the preprocessor, or family features off or on in the preprocessor.
- After selecting the preprocessor options, I then want to run the dimensiona reduction method on the dataset. I then want to see the the observations in reduced dimensionality to understand the variation in the dataset. In two dimensions, this would be a scatter plot. In three dimensions, this would be a 3D scatter plot. I want to use plotly for this.
- I want a sidebar that lets me see options available for preprocessing the data, and for the dimension reduction method to use. I want to be able to select PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP as the dimension reduction method, but the default should be PCA.
- I want to be able to use the reduced dimensionality to cluster the observations. I want to be able to select KMeans or DBSCAN as the clustering method, but the default should be KMeans. 
- I want to be able to select the number of clusters using if KMeans is selected.
- I want to be able to color the observations in the reduced dimensionality plot by cluster assignment, or by a feature in the dataset. I want to be able to select the feature to color by from a dropdown menu.
